    ### COVID-19 Data Analysis Report

    #### Objective 1: Identify Age Groups Most Affected by COVID-19
    - The age group most affected by COVID-19 in terms of total deaths is **75-84**
      with **6,994,508.0 deaths**.
    - The highest death rate (normalized by mentions) is in the **85+** group
      with a rate of **0.90 deaths per mention**.

    #### Objective 2: Understand Age-Related Vulnerabilities
    - The age group with the **highest booster dose rate** is **80+** 
      with **50.79% coverage**.
    - The age group with the **lowest booster dose rate** is **0-4** 
      with **0.00% coverage**.
    - The average booster dose rate across all age groups is **32.01%**.

    #### Objective 3: Provide Data-Driven Insights for Public Health Strategies
    1. Older populations (e.g., 65+) exhibit both the highest death rates and the highest booster coverage, highlighting the success of targeted public health interventions.
    2. Younger populations, particularly those under 30, have lower booster coverage, leaving them more vulnerable to severe outcomes.
    3. Public health strategies should prioritize campaigns to improve booster coverage among younger age groups while maintaining efforts to protect older populations.
    4. Regular monitoring of trends, such as death rates and vaccination coverage, is crucial for responding to potential outbreaks and ensuring public health preparedness.

    #### Recommendations:
    1. Increase booster dose uptake among younger populations to improve immunity.
    2. Sustain high vaccination rates among older populations to prevent resurgence in deaths.
    3. Utilize data-driven insights to monitor and respond to public health challenges proactively.
